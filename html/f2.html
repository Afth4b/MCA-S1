            <P>A web browser is an application software that can process and display a web page on the internet.
                The web browser is capable to make a request for web services and documents to web server.
                It acts an interface between the server and the client.
                As web browser is a software, thus it is to be installed on the client computer and used to surf the
                internet for websites and web pages. Popular examples of web browsers include Google Chrome,
                Microsoft Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Opera Mini, etc.</P>

            <P>A web server is a dedicated computer that sends web based documents to the client's computer when request
                through the web browser. A web server accepts HTTP request from the client's browser,
                processes it to find the required document, and then sends a suitable response to client machine.

                A web server is a basically a set of hardware and software whose primary function is to serve
                web-based material through the internet on demand.</P>

    <div>
        <h1 style="color: rgb(10, 78, 36);">Communication Between Web Browser and Web Server</h1>
        <p>Web browsers and web servers function together as a client-server system. In computer networking,
            client-server is a standard method for designing applications where data is kept in central locations
            (server computers) and efficiently shared with any number of other computers (the clients) on request.
            All web browsers function as clients that request information from websites (servers).

            Numerous web browser clients can request data from the same website. Requests can happen at different
            times or simultaneously. Client-server systems conceptually call for all requests to the same site to
            be handled by one server. In practice, however, because the volume of requests to web servers can
            sometimes grow very large, web servers are often built as a distributed pool of server computers.

            For websites popular in different countries around the world, this web server pool is geographically
            distributed to help improve the response time to browsers. If the server is closer to the requesting
            device, the time it takes to deliver the content is faster than if the server were further away.</p>
